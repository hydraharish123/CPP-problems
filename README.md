# Problem Solutions Repository

Welcome to my repository! Here, I maintain solutions to problems I have solved on **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**. These solutions are written in C++ and organized for easy reference.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main platforms:
- **LeetCode**: Contains solutions to problems solved on LeetCode.
- **Codeforces**: Contains solutions to problems solved on Codeforces.

Each file is named after the problem or has a reference to the problem ID for easier identification.
